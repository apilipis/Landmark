# Landmark
#### social media on the blockchain

Landmark is a smart-contract for ethereum to implement a social network.
This means that it is completely decentralized, permanent, uncensorable form of communication.
Every time you set a "mark", the message is etched into the blockchain forever.

The canonical address is

    0x00000000000000000000000000000

But you can build your own "Landmark" by deploying it to the blockchain.
If you build one, let us know and we'll list it here!

### Roadmap
