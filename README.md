# Landmark
_social media on the blockchain_

Landmark is a social network implemented as a smart-contract for ethereum.
It is completely decentralized, permanent, uncensorable form of communication.
When you _mark_, the message is etched into the blockchain forever.

The canonical address is

    0x00000000000000000000000000000

But you can build your own "Landmark" by deploying it to the blockchain.
If you build one, let us know and we'll list it here!

### Roadmap
